# Project status — 2026-10-20

> Snapshot source: GitHub default-branch refs and latest visible workflow runs, plus read-only inspection of known Termux working copies. This is not an all-tests-passing statement. The connected GitHub log tool returned BlobNotFound/404 when downloading failed job logs; root causes remain UNDIAGNOSED until logs are inspected by another route.

## Local worktree preservation

Read-only inspection found pre-existing uncommitted changes. No checkout, reset, clean, rebase, stash, commit, or pull was performed during this audit.

### ~/LudoMada
- Branch feat/gameplay-cosmetics-v1; HEAD 78e6af2.
- Modified: scripts/ludomada-connect.sh, scripts/ludomada-status.sh, scripts/ludomada-stop.sh, scripts/ludomada-watchdog.sh and multiple files under tools/personal-mcp-commander/ including control-plane.mjs, dashboard.mjs, package files, server, UI, audit and smoke files.
- Untracked: LudoMada-jouer-fix/.
- Required next step: create a recoverable patch/checkpoint of all changes before touching this worktree. Respect AGENTS.md: the experimental ACEP worker explicitly protects ~/LudoMada and .ludomada-agent.

### ~/NanouBrowser
- Branch android-alternative; HEAD ece5cd9.
- Modified: app/build.gradle, app/src/main/java/com/nanou/browser/BrowserUrlResolver.java, gradle.properties, settings.gradle.
- Untracked: build-manual/.
- Required next step: preserve build artifacts, inspect diff, then run Android-specific checks without merging the agent-service branch into the Android branch.

### ~/projects/nanoumada
- Branch main; HEAD 0467119; local status says behind 32.
- Modified: app/components/chat/BaseChat.tsx, Chat.client.tsx, ExamplePrompts.tsx, app/components/settings/providers/ProvidersTab.tsx, app/lib/.server/llm/model.ts, app/routes/api.chat.ts, app/utils/constants.ts.
- Required next step: capture diffs/backup first; determine which changes are local-only before synchronizing against current remote main.

### Games and temporary checkouts
- Local RamiMada/LotoMada/DominoMada checkouts show September 26 commits while GitHub main refs show October 13 commits. Local remote-tracking refs may be stale; do not assume they are current.
- ~/tmp/nanou-browser-agent-check has untracked Python __pycache__ directories. Do not delete them automatically; review whether they are disposable after preserving state.
- A separate PC-Free checkout and a local Mega-Project clone were not found in searched paths; this does not prove they do not exist elsewhere.

## Open pull requests observed

- Mega-project-apps: [#2](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/mega-project-apps/pull/2) draft CircleCI cloud fallback; its description says tests/users.test.js fails and the first CircleCI run has not been verified.
- LudoMada: open work includes PRs #135 (runtime canary), #134 (Cloudflare Workers runtime), #132 (hosted/ARM64 validation), #126 (Ramus accessibility), and #115 (3D market/release verification). Do not merge based on one green job; evaluate release gates together.
- Nanou Browser: [#2](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/nanou-browser/pull/2) browser agent and [#1](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/nanou-browser/pull/1) navigation/render recovery are draft PRs.
- PC-Free: [#2](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/PC-Free/pull/2) draft Windows setup fix.
- RamiMada/LotoMada/DominoMada: each has a draft CircleCI cloud-build fallback PR #1.
- Nanoumada returned no open PRs from the current query.

## Control-plane PR validation update — 2026-10-20

Draft PR [#3](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/mega-project-apps/pull/3) was created from this snapshot branch and remains unmerged. After creation, GitHub Actions reported:
- ACEP CI run [39374308312](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/mega-project-apps/actions/runs/39374308312): FAIL, job "gate".
- Security Audit run [39374308508](https://github.com/pascalnanousympathie-alt/mega-project-apps/actions/runs/39374308508): FAIL in Trivy, Semgrep, OSV PR scan and Gitleaks.

The workflow-job step summary returned no step details for ACEP CI, and direct job-log retrieval is unavailable through the connected integration. These failures are therefore not attributed to the new Markdown files without evidence; their precise cause remains UNDIAGNOSED. Do not merge PR #3 until CI failure causes are identified and required gates pass or an explicitly reviewed policy decision is made.

## Local checkpoint update — 2026-10-20

Created and verified a private local checkpoint directory outside the project repositories:
- Path: `~/.project-checkpoints/20261020-parallel-start/`
- Captured branch, HEAD, git status, and tracked-change patch for LudoMada, NanouBrowser, Nanoumada and the temporary Nanou Browser agent checkout.
- Archived the git-untracked paths from those worktrees where present. The original worktrees were re-read afterward and their dirty status remained unchanged.
- The checkpoint is for recovery only. Do not apply patches blindly: review them first, and keep secrets out of commits and status reports.

Next safe action: investigate GitHub job output for the failing checks using a different read path, then work on isolated branches. Do not alter the protected LudoMada worktree until its pre-existing changes have been reviewed.

## Evidence gaps

- Failed workflow logs could not be downloaded through the connected GitHub log tool; it returned 404 BlobNotFound. Scanner/test failure root causes remain UNDIAGNOSED. Do not suppress, skip, or rerun all workflows blindly.
- Default-branch SHAs and run outcomes were read from GitHub API on 2026-10-20. Local working-copy state came from read-only inspection of the connected Termux device. No project tests were run in this status-only audit.
- No deployment, merge, payment, secret change, or production change was performed.
